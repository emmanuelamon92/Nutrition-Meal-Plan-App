# Building a Client-Side Application with React

## Objectives

1. Build a React single page application from scratch
2. Apply your knowledge of components, props and state management
3. Incorporate client-side routing
5. GET and POST data in a mock up backend

## React Project Overview

This assignment is open-ended when it comes to the actual content. You are free to create
whatever you'd like, as long as it incorporates the requirements listed in these instructions.

If you don't have any inspiration at the moment, here are a couple of ideas:

- Instagram, but only for dog and cat pictures
- A weather app that changes style based on the weather
- A reddit feed for researching stocks
- Duolingo for being a better neighbor
- A turn-based boardgame

## Requirements

- Use the `create-react-app` generator to start your project.
	- Follow the instructions on this repo to setup the generator: [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
- Your app should have one HTML page to render your react application
- Your app should use multiple components in a way that keeps your code well organized.
- Your appp must make use of `react-router`
	- There should be 3 client-side routes
- Your app must use `fetch` to GET (read) and POST (create) data on your own JSON server
- Your application should have some minimal styling: feel free to incorporate a UI framework (like [react-bootstrap][] or [material-ui][]), but if you want to write CSS yourself, go for it!

Go wild! These are only the basic requirements â€” you're free to add on as much stuff as you'd like.

[material-ui]: https://material-ui.com/
